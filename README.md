### spider

  Webcrawler written in Go, to learn Go.

#### General Go Stuffs

  godocs say that most go devs use a single workspace for all repositories. i've
set my gopath to `/Users/riley/golang`, and intend to use the singular workspace
setup. With spider installed, my tree looks like:

```
.
├── bin
│   └── spider
└── src
    └── github.com
        └── rileyr
            └── spider
                ├── README.md
                └── spider.go
```
